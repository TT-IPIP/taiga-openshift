Hey there and thank you for using Issue Tracker!

Our project, as you've probably heard, is getting really popular and truth is we're getting a bit overwhelmed by the activity surrounding it. There are just too many issues for us to manage properly.

Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.

None of the above, create a bug report
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that someone can help. If the info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal code snippet** / [rnplay](https://rnplay.org/) example that reproduces the bug.
- [ ] Provide **screenshots** where appropriate
- [ ] What's the **version** of Openshift you're using?
- [ ] Are you using Mac, Linux or Windows?
